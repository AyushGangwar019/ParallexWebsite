            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport 
                of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched 
                glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot 
                sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended
                 below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension 
                 lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the 
                 wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the 
                 outside.
                <br><br>
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and 
                cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours 
                and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful 
                exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing
                to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

            <h2 class="desc">Surfing</h2>
        </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
                <br><br>
The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.

                Cycling, also, when on a two-wheeled bicycle, called bicycling or biking, is the use of cycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport.[1] People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists",[2] "bicyclists",[3] or "bikers".[4] Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).
                <br><br>
                Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.[5] They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world, especially in densely populated European cities.[6]
                
                Cycling is widely regarded as an effective and efficient mode of transportation[7][8] optimal for short to moderate distances.
